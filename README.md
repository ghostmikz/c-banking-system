## ⚙️ How to Compile

Open terminal, navigate to the `src/` directory and run:

```
gcc main.c -o banking
```

🚀 How to Run

Still inside the src/ directory, execute the program with:

```
./banking
```

Make sure the data/ folder exists in the parent directory. If it does not exist, create it:

```
mkdir ../data
```

📂 Session Logging

Every time a user logs in successfully, their account number and timestamp are saved in data/session.dat. The format is:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] AccountNumber
```

This helps track login history.

📝 Notes

PIN is required to make deposits, withdrawals, or transfers.

Data is stored in plain text format and not encrypted.
